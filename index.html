            <h2> <b>Hexed</b> is a mobile app that is centered around hex codes. The user is able to take a picture and
                grab colors from it. Once the user grabs colors, they will be able to see the hex code and send it to
                their email address in order to utilize it in a CSS or Adobe Suite file. The user can also create
                palettes based on images and additionally add or subtract colors. They are also able to create Linear,
                Radial, Angular, or Diamond gradients from palettes.

                The focus for this app was placed on a minimal number of actions that would be executed seamlessly in a
                visually satisfying and appealing way. </h2>

            <h2> The research process for Hexed began with peforming a task analyais of competitive applications focused
                on color for designers and artists.
                <br> <br>
                Once we solidified the idea for our app and narrowed down our focus, we held 1:1, 15 minute interviews
                with 5 creatives. The goal of these interviews was to understand what they believed would be beneficial
                to an app surounding Hex Codes as well as their personal process and struggles with implementing colors
                in their work.
                <br> <br>
                We compiled a list of 10 questions that we used as the framework for our interviews.
                <br> <br>
                “Is there a particular format or value that would help you implement color seamlessly into your
                workflow?”
                <br> <br>
                ”Where do you get inspiration for the colors that you utilize in your work?”
                <br> <br>

            <h2>Designing Hexed was one of the first experiences I have had with designing an application till the
                prototyping phase. I enjoyed the process of iterating this app as well as creating a professional visual
                style and brand. I hope to iterate further and push this into the development phase.
                <br> <br>
                One of the biggest challenges with designing Hexed was creating the dark mode frames. It was not a
                challenge I anticipated with realized shortly after the importance of choosing the right colors to
                display for an optimal user experience.
